Putting on a good party is what the Spanish do best. Even the smallest, sleepiest village comes to vigorous life within seconds of someone shouting 'Fiesta!!'

<dt>Summer Solstice - Bonfires in honour of San Jua (Teulada and Moraira)</dt>
<dd>A combination of pagan and christian tradition on the main beach (L'Ampolla) in Moraira; while theoretically in celebration of St John the Baptist, rituals include leaping over the fire embers, bathing in the sea at midnight to cleanse body and spirit, and learn the secrets of traditional rememdies. There's also dinner on the beach, children's entertainment and other celebrations in Town Hall Square in Teulada.</dd>

<dt>4-9 July - Fiestas of Font Santa (Moraira)</dt>
<dd>Legend has it that Moraira's patron saint (San Vicente Ferrer), achieved one of his miracles just outside Moraira. Weak with thirst on a journey from Alicante to Valencia, he struck a rock with his stick and out poured fresh water.  The ensuing fountain survives, and a chapel has been built. You can find the rock and the fiesta by searching for the adjoining Go-Kart track of the same name:  Font Santa.</dd>
