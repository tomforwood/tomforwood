The town of Moraira is built around an old fishing village. The marina is still a central feature of the seafront, and well worth a stroll around to admire the yachts and pleasure boats. Further round the bay, the main beach is overlooked by an 18th Century fort that was built to protect the town from Berber pirates.<!-- more --> The cafes and bars dotted along the promenade are pleasant places to while away a couple of hours, and the backstreets are well supplied with amenities; banks, a post-office, pharmacy, bakeries, a small supermarket etc.  Many larger supermarkets are dotted around the outskirts of town and are best acccessed by car. A short drive round the coast to the east is the small but beautifully formed beach of el Portet.

The main beach in Moraira is sheltered, not too large, and well set up for families. During summer there is often a lifeguard on duty. The beach is backed by a children&acute;s playground and surrounded by seafront cafes, restaurants and shops.   A small stream runs round the back of the beach, which, by all accounts, is pleasantly challenging for children to dam.


<h2 class="clearleft">Local Market</h2>

A market is held every Friday in the large, free car park in Moraira. 08h30-13h30.
The same market also visits Teulada, the nearest town, on Wednesdays at the same times.  For location, <a href="/moraira.html#map">see map</a>. We can recommend the fresh nuts!


<h2 class="clearleft" >El Portet</h2>

El Portet is a quiet cove at the eastern end of the resort of Moraira. It&acute;s quite a walk round the coastal road from the centre of town, so we&acute;d recommend jumping in the car. There&acute;s a free car park not far from the beach.

As a beach, El Portet is quite narrow, so is always going to be more about snorkelling, swimming and other watersports than beach cricket and epic sandcastles. But it is lovely and quiet.  More active visitors can take a short but precipitous walk up to the watchtower for excellent views.  El Portet comes into its own at sunset - The El Portet bay and looming Pe&ntilde;yon d&acute;Ifach in Calpe frame the scene perfectly.  Grab a seat at one of the two relaxed beachside bars, order a Ca&ntilde;a (a can of Spanish beer) and watch the show.


For special occasions, try the El Dauphin restaurant in El Portet, situated just further along the beach from the bars.  Trip Advisor reviews seem mixed though, so check out these before booking and let us know what you think!
