In the summer, warm winds blow inland from the Mediterranean, making the Costa Blanca the perfect place for windsurfing or kitesurfing. However the seas are still warm and calm enough to enjoy kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding (SUP), wakeboarding or just plain old swimming. <!-- more -->Unfortunately it seems quite difficult to find a boat to wakeboard behind these days, apparently due to the prohibitive costs of all the licences, but there's still the cable park in Benidorm. If you find a centre that does offer wakeboats, we want to know please!
