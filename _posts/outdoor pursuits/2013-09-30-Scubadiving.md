The waters around Moraira offer pleasant scenic diving at relatively shallow depths (5-30m) Most require a boat but there is a fun shore dive to be had off El Portet beach.  <!-- more -->Being keen scuba divers ourselves, we'd love to hear from other diving guests what the sites are like at different times of year. Please follow the local advice of a dive centre listed below before going diving, and dive within your qualifications and comfort zones. Have fun!
